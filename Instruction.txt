Part A: Small dataset 
We have a small dataset with only 100 products. You can try this small dataset to see different images for different products. 
To run small dataset: 
1. In seed folder, comment products: require('./groceries.json') and uncomment products: require('./100_grocery.json')
2. Do npm run seed in api folder.


Part B: Whole dataset of products with 60000 training data.
We only trained 60000 data from the training dataset, so some of the products does not exist in the FP-Growth tree which means they will not have any recommnedation.
